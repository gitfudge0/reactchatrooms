# React Chat Rooms

A react/redux chatroom application that let's users join into chatrooms of their choice. After entering a chatroom, users can engage in a conversation with everyone in the chatroom. This is a MERN stack application built from scratch.

### Getting Started

Run the following commands to clone the repo and start using the application

```
git clone https://github.com/thediggu/reactchatrooms
npm i
npm run start
```

### Dev docs

`npm run start` runs webpack to compile the client with a watcher and starts nodemon to serve backend. Both client and server are run on a different port for dev use.

`npm run client` starts a webpack dev server only.

`npm run server` starts nodemon and the server.

`npm run build` builds the client into the `public` folder for you to deploy.
