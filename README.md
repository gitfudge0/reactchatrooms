### Getting Started

Clone the repo and install all dependencies

### Dev docs

`npm run start` runs webpack to compile the client with a watcher and starts nodemon to serve backend. Both client and server are run on a different port for dev use.

`npm run client` starts a webpack dev server only.

`npm run server` starts nodemon and the server.

`npm run build` builds the client into the `public` folder for you to deploy.
